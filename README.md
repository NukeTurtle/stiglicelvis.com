# My Portfolio page

## Description 

A portfolio of work to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.
This portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can‚Äôt be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

With these points in mind, in this Challenge I'll set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I'll get to practice my new skills while creating something that I will use during my job search. It‚Äôs a win-win that I'll likely be grateful for in the future!

   [x] When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications  
   [x] When presented with the my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
