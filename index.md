        <p class="xpText">
            In 2022 I joined EyeKandy as a contractor. Since then I worked on numerous projects with their teams of designers and project managers, building highly interactive product pages that look and behave exactly like their mobile apps.
            Some of the more notable clients included Intel, Bacardi, Dewar's, Frubes and more. I translated their Figma designs into pixel-perfect, fully responsive mobile and desktop versions.<br>
            A few examples below:
